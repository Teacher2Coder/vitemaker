# Vite Maker

## Description
This package is designed to start up a Vite React App with relative ease. Most of the tools that make React Apps don't have all the setup that I like, so I am just creating my own. This program will complete create a Vite React App with React, Vite, Tailwind, PostCss Axios, Framer-Motion and Eslint allready installed and configured. The user also has the option to add additional packages as desired.

I could have created this project a litle more simply with a Node.js app, but I have been loving the .NET Framework as of late, so I decided to build it using that system instead!

## Installation
Ensure that you have the .NET SDK installed. You can do so by running ```dotnet --version```. If you need help installing the .NET SDK, please take a look at the docs [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

Once you have confirmed that the .NET SDK has been installed, you should be good to go!

## Usage
1. Navigate to the directory that you want to create the React App in.
2. In your console, run ```dotnet run --project <PATH_TO_VITEMAKER>```
3. Answer the questions when prompted
4. cd into your newly created React App
5. Run ```npm run dev``` to test functionality

Pro Tip: Configure an alias in your .aliases file that runs the console command. This way you do not have to memorize the path to this project!

Also, this project can work very will with my [README-Generator Project](https://github.com/Teacher2Coder/README-CS). After creating your app, navigate into it and run my README-Generator to create a nice and easy README.md for your project as well!
